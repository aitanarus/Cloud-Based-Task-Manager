Testing Strategy:
Unit Tests:

Core (Models): Validation and business logic tests.
Infrastructure (Repositories): Test database interactions using mocks or in-memory databases.
Blazor Components: Test UI logic and event handling with bUnit.
Integration Tests:

Services: Test interaction with repositories.
API Controllers: Test the interaction between the API and services using TestServer.
End-to-End (E2E) Tests:

Use Playwright or Selenium to ensure the Blazor front end, API, and database interactions work correctly.
Test Coverage:

Use Coverlet and ReportGenerator to monitor test coverage and ensure your code is well tested.
